## Understanding Your Results

### Key Metrics Explained

**Credits Consumed:**
- Snowflake compute credits used by Cortex services
- Source: `ACCOUNT_USAGE` views (authoritative billing data)
- Matches what appears on your Snowflake bill

**Cost:**
- Credits x Credit Price (configured in calculator)
- **Important:** Credit prices vary by contract
- Always verify pricing with Snowflake account team

**Credits Per User:**
- Average daily credits per active user
- Only calculated when user tracking available
- Useful for per-seat cost modeling

**Credits Per Operation:**
- Average credits per request/token/page processed
- Varies significantly by service and workload
- Use for capacity planning

### Projection Methodology

**How projections work:**
1. **Baseline:** Average daily credit usage from historical data
2. **Growth rate:** Compound monthly growth applied to baseline
3. **Variance:** +/-X% range around projection (configurable)
4. **Cumulative:** Sum of all months in projection period

**Formula:**
```
Monthly Credits = Baseline x (1 + Growth Rate) ^ Month Number
Monthly Cost = Monthly Credits x Credit Price
```

**Important Notes:**
- Projections assume compound growth (exponential)
- Not guarantees - use as directional estimates
- Update monthly as actual usage accumulates
- Consider seasonality and adoption curves

### Data Accuracy

**What's accurate:**
- Historical credit consumption (from `ACCOUNT_USAGE`)
- Service breakdown (from detailed usage views)
- Date ranges and time series (actual data)

**What's estimated:**
- Future growth rates (user-defined assumptions)
- User adoption patterns (may vary significantly)
- Credit pricing (depends on contract terms)

**Best practice:**
- Present projections with variance ranges
- Document assumptions clearly
- Update forecasts as actuals come in
- Use conservative scenarios for budgeting

### Data Latency

Note: `ACCOUNT_USAGE` has 45 minutes to 3 hours latency.

- Recent usage may not appear immediately
- Wait 3+ hours after activity before expecting data
- Not suitable for real-time monitoring
- Designed for historical analysis and planning

**Reference:** [Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE latency documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage#label-account-usage-views)

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this safe to deploy in production?**
A: Yes. The solution is read-only, creates isolated views, and has zero impact on existing workloads. It only queries `ACCOUNT_USAGE` views which are designed for this purpose.

**Q: Will this impact our Snowflake bill?**
A: Minimal impact. View queries use your existing warehouse and consume trivial credits. Typical cost: < $1/month.

**Q: Can we customize the views?**
A: Yes. All SQL is provided and can be modified. Add filters, change date ranges, or create custom aggregations.

**Q: How do we remove everything?**
A: Run `sql/99_cleanup/cleanup_all.sql`. Complete removal in seconds. See [Cleanup](#cleanup--removal) section.

### Data Questions

**Q: Why are my views empty?**
A: Three common reasons:
1. No Cortex usage in the lookback period (check with `SELECT usage_date, service_type, credits_used, credits_used_compute, credits_used_cloud_services FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY WHERE service_type = 'AI_SERVICES' ORDER BY usage_date DESC LIMIT 30`)
2. Data latency (wait 3 hours after usage)
3. Lookback period too short (extend to 90 or 180 days)

**Q: Some services show no user counts. Why?**
A: This is expected. Some `ACCOUNT_USAGE` views (like Cortex Search hourly aggregates) don't include user-level detail. User tracking is available for Cortex Analyst, Document AI, and Functions (query-level).

**Q: Can I export data to Excel/Tableau/PowerBI?**
A: Yes. Query any view and use Snowflake's download feature to export as CSV. Import into your tool of choice.

**Q: How far back can I query historical data?**
A: Limited by `ACCOUNT_USAGE` retention, typically 1 year. Adjust lookback period in queries as needed.

### Calculator Questions

**Q: Can multiple SEs use the same calculator?**
A: Yes. Each SE uploads their customer's CSV independently. No data is stored between sessions.

**Q: What credit price should I use?**
A: Verify with the customer's Snowflake account team. Credit prices vary by:
- Snowflake edition (Standard, Enterprise, Business Critical)
- Cloud provider and region (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Contract terms and commitments
- On-demand vs capacity pricing

**Reference:** [Snowflake pricing documentation](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/)

**Q: How accurate are the projections?**
A: Projections are directional estimates based on your growth assumptions. They become more accurate with:
- Longer historical periods (14+ days recommended)
- Stable usage patterns
- Regular updates as actuals come in

Always present projections with variance ranges.

**Q: Can customers use this themselves?**
A: Absolutely. Customers can deploy both monitoring and calculator in their own account for self-service cost management.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What Snowflake privileges are required?**
A: Minimum requirements:
- `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` on `SNOWFLAKE` database (for `ACCOUNT_USAGE` access)
- `CREATE DATABASE` on account (for deployment)
- `CREATE SCHEMA` on database
- `CREATE VIEW` on schema

Or simply use `ACCOUNTADMIN` role.

**Q: Can this run on Snowflake Marketplace?**
A: Not currently, but views can be shared via [Secure Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro).

**Q: What Python packages are required?**
A: All listed in `environment.yml`:
- streamlit (pre-installed in Streamlit in Snowflake)
- snowflake-snowpark-python (pre-installed)
- pandas, numpy (commonly available)
- plotly (for visualizations)

**Q: Can I schedule the calculator to email reports?**
A: Not directly. The Streamlit app is interactive. For scheduled reports, query the views directly and use [Snowflake tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro) to email results.

## Cleanup & Removal

### Complete Removal

```sql
-- Run cleanup script
sql/99_cleanup/cleanup_all.sql
```

The script provides three removal options:

**Option 1: Drop views only** (keeps database and schema)
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS V_CORTEX_COST_EXPORT;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS V_CORTEX_DAILY_SUMMARY;
-- ... (drops all 21 views)
```

**Option 2: Drop schema** (removes views and schema)
```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.CORTEX_USAGE CASCADE;
```

**Option 3: Drop database** (complete removal)
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE CASCADE;
```

**Remove Streamlit app:**
```sql
DROP STREAMLIT IF EXISTS CORTEX_COST_CALCULATOR;
```

### Safety

Cleanup is completely safe:
- Only affects monitoring objects (views, schema, database)
- Never touches source data in `ACCOUNT_USAGE`
- Never touches customer data or other databases
- Can re-deploy instantly if needed

## Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Test in sandbox first** - Deploy to dev/test account before production
2. **Verify permissions** - Check `ACCOUNT_USAGE` access before deployment
3. **Document customizations** - Note any changes to lookback periods or naming
4. **Grant minimal access** - Only give SELECT on views, not entire database

### For Cost Estimation

1. **Include variance ranges** - Never present single-point estimates
2. **Update monthly** - Refresh projections as actual usage accumulates
3. **Validate pricing** - Confirm credit costs with Snowflake account team
4. **Show assumptions** - Document growth rates and methodology clearly
5. **Track accuracy** - Compare projections to actuals over time

### For Stakeholder Presentations

1. **Lead with ranges** - "Estimated $10K-$15K/month" not "$12.5K/month"
2. **Explain methodology** - Briefly describe how projections are calculated
3. **Show scenarios** - Present multiple growth scenarios side-by-side
4. **Provide exports** - Give stakeholders CSV files for their own analysis
5. **Set expectations** - Emphasize these are estimates, not commitments

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Data latency:** 45 min - 3 hour lag in `ACCOUNT_USAGE` views (Snowflake platform limitation)
2. **User tracking:** Some services lack individual user attribution (platform limitation)
3. **Historical data:** Limited to `ACCOUNT_USAGE` retention (typically 1 year)
4. **Projection assumptions:** Growth rates are user-defined estimates, not guarantees
5. **Token estimates:** Some token counts are approximations

**All limitations are platform constraints, not tool defects.**

## Demo Expiration Policy

This demonstration project includes mandatory expiration controls:

**Expiration Date:** 2026-02-04 (30 days from creation)

**Enforcement Mechanisms:**
1. **Deployment Check:** `deploy_all.sql` blocks execution after expiration date
2. **Object Comments:** All Snowflake objects tagged with expiration date
3. **GitHub Actions:** Automated workflow (`.github/workflows/expire-demo.yml`) opens warning issues and attempts to archive/make private after expiration (requires `MASTER_PAT` for repo-admin actions)
4. **README Badge:** Visual expiration indicator at top of documentation

**Why Expiration?**
- Prevents outdated code examples from being discovered and deployed
- Ensures demos reflect current Snowflake features and syntax
- Protects users from deprecated patterns and best practices drift
- Maintains quality standards across SE Community demonstrations

**After Expiration:**
- Repository will be automatically archived
- Contact SE Community for updated version with current features
- Expiration enforcement cannot be bypassed without modifying source code

**Maintained by:** SE Community
**Last Updated:** November 25, 2025
